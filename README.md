# if you want to see the codes, here it is.
# if you want to run it "python3.9 Main.py" will do the work. python3.8 or below versions will not work
# if you want to create an exe:
## in windows "pip install pyinstaller" then in the project folder
"pyinstaller --onefile Main.pyw" commands will create and exe in "dist" folder
## in linux if python3.9 is your default python interpreter 
("python3 --version" for check) do the same like in windows
if it is not don't even try. it is a complete nightmare.
if you insist, then you don't need my help...
